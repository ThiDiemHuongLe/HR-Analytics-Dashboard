# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

There is an interesting saying that I came across: "People dont leave jobs because of their workload but because of toxic environment"

There are always a lot going on in an organisation that top management have to take care of and one of which is high staff turnover. Sometimes, this problem does not speak
itself unless management team has an effective way to monitor and improve it. 

So, this HR Analytics dashboard is designed to keep the CEOs being posted at all times, 
understanding which department or which role that attrition is high and tackle it right away before it becomes a domino effect. High attrition is costly to business and surely, they want to manage this rate as low as possible.

On top of that, I initiated this project to fulfill my curiosity as a former payroll specialist. I would love to use my prior experience as domain knowledge to apply in
Data. 

Let's start this interesting dashboard!

Thank you!
